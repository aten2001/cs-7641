Execute my code by running this command:
python mdp_test.py

All of the plots and text files with run times will go in the output folder.

Alterately, you can get all my code with this command:
git clone https://github.com/rbaxter1/CS7641.git

Note that due to randomness, the newly generated plots may be different from those in the report. I saved all my report figures to the figures directory.
